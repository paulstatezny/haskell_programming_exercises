-- Interesting thing about function signatures:
-- The more specific a type, the _more_ types the function can accept but the _less_ we can do with it.
-- The more generic a type, the _less_ types the function can accept but the _more_ we can do with it.


-- A function is polymorphic when its type signature has variables that can represent more than one type. That is, its parameters are polymorphic. Parametric polymorphism refers to fully polymor- phic (unconstrained by a type class) parameters. Parametricity is the property we get from having parametric polymorphism. Para- metricity means that the behavior of a function with respect to the types of its (parametrically polymorphic) arguments is uniform. The behavior can not change just because it was applied to an argument of a different type.


-- Write a type signature Section

functionC x y =
  if (x > y) then True else False


-- Given a type, write the function Section
